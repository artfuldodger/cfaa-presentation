					<h1>CFAA</h1>
					<h3>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is it?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Passed in 1984</li>
						<li>Goal: “Reduce cracking … and to address federal computer-related offenses” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030" target="_blank">Full text of 18 U.S.C. § 1030</a></li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>“Section 1030 of Title 18 of the United States Code”. Title 18 of the US Code is what defines federal crimes and criminal procedure. It's in chapter 47, which deals with, appropriately enough, fraud.</p>

						<p>Before the Internet was omnipresent in the workplace; very limited presence in the home.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Violations</h2>
					<blockquote>intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains— …  information from any protected computer</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Violations</h2>
					<blockquote>Whoever conspires to commit or attempts to commit an offense</blockquote>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Does that cover port scanning?</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Investigation Authority</h2>
					<p>The Secret Service</p>
					<p class="fragment">Plus the FBI and whoever else is interested.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>“The United States Secret Service shall, in addition to any other agency having such authority, have the authority to investigate offenses under this section.”</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>"Protected Computer"</h2>
					<p>Pretty much every computer connected to the Internet</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>“'protected computer' means a computer … which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication”</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What's a computer?</h2>
					<p>If it can connect to Internet, it probably counts.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>“the term “computer” means an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device, but such term does not include an automated typewriter or typesetter, a portable hand held calculator, or other similar device;”</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Noteworthy Cases</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="case-name fragment"><span class="case-name">United States v. Lori Drew</span>, 2008</li>
						<li class="case-name fragment"><span class="case-name">United States v. Bradley Manning</span>, 2010-</li>
						<li class="case-name fragment"><span class="case-name">United States v. Aaron Swartz</span>, 2011</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Lori Drew - Cyber bullying. Judge decided that convicting as an offense under the CFAA due to violating MySpace's terms of use would make it too broad. Hooray. This was by a District Judge, however. Don't believe this has been decided by the Supreme Court yet.</p>
						<p>Bradley Manning - Leaked cables to Wikileaks</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Aaron Swartz</h2>
					<p>Reddit developer</p>
					<p>On working group of RSS 1.0 spec when he was 14</p>
					<p>Helped defeat SOPA/PIPA (see <a href="http://www.demandprogress.org">Demand Progress</a>)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Aaron Swartz</h2>
					<p>Set up a laptop in an MIT wiring closet to download articles from JSTOR</p>

					<aside class="notes">

					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Punishment?</h2>
					<blockquote>
						AARON SWARTZ, 24, was charged in an indictment with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer. If convicted on these charges, SWARTZ faces up to 35 years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, restitution, forfeiture and a fine of up to $1 million.
					</blockquote>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Aaron Swartz hanged himself on January 11th.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<blockquote>
						I believe that Aaron’s death was caused by a criminal justice system that prioritizes power over mercy, vengeance over justice; a system that punishes innocent people for trying to prove their innocence instead of accepting plea deals that mark them as criminals in perpetuity; a system where incentives and power structures align for prosecutors to destroy the life of an innovator like Aaron in the pursuit of their own ambitions.
